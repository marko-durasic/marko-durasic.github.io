# A Guide for Aspiring Software Developers

If you're just starting out in the world of software development, you may be wondering where to begin. In this blog post, I will provide a suggested learning path for aspiring software developers, including courses and resources for learning the necessary skills and preparing for job interviews.

## Programming Course

### Complete Python Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery

I recommend starting with a course in Python, as it is a popular and versatile programming language used in a wide range of applications. The "Complete Python Developer in 2023: Zero to Mastery" course on Udemy is a great option because it is newly updated and covers complex topics in an easy-to-understand manner. This course is suitable for beginners and is offered by the same company that teaches Data Structures and Algorithms on Udemy.

## Data Structures and Algorithms + Coding Interview Questions

### Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms

Once you have a solid foundation in Python, it's time to start preparing for coding interviews. The "Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms" course on Udemy covers theoretical concepts and practical techniques for solving coding interview questions. Though the course uses JavaScript, the logic behind the code is what matters most.

## Practice Coding Interview Questions (In Parallel)

### AlgoExpert

To become proficient in solving coding interview questions, it is essential to practice as much as possible. I recommend using AlgoExpert to practice coding interview questions. While it isn't free, it's reasonably priced and provides a curated list of questions. Start with the easy ones in each category before moving on to more difficult questions.

### LeetCode

LeetCode is also a great resource for practicing coding interview questions. It offers a large number of free questions. However, the sheer number can be overwhelming, so AlgoExpert's curated list might be more beginner-friendly.
