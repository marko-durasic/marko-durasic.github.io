# Remote Senior Go & AWS Developer for Hire

Need a remote senior software engineer who can own Go services, modernize AWS, and mentor your team without a months-long hiring process? As an **AWS Certified Developer (DVA-C02)** with a decade of Go experience, I help distributed startups and scaleups ship faster while keeping cloud costs predictable. Think of this as hiring both a principal Go engineer and a pragmatic cloud architect—without adding full-time headcount immediately.

## Who hires me
- **Product-led SaaS teams** that need a principal-level Go engineer to stabilize and extend APIs and cloud infrastructure.
- **Fintech and data companies** chasing lower latency, stronger security, or compliance readiness across AWS services.
- **Consultancies & agencies** that need trusted delivery leadership for client projects spanning Go, Lambda, ECS/EKS, or serverless.
- **DevRel & training orgs** that want an AWS-certified engineer to teach, write, and coach.

## Engagement options
- **Remote full-time** — join as a contracted Senior/Principal Go & AWS engineer while you close a permanent hire.
- **Freelance/contract** — scoped backlog delivery, migrations, AWS modernization, and performance initiatives.
- **Fractional leadership** — 1–2 days per week covering architecture reviews, planning, hiring support, and AWS governance.
- **Mentorship pods** — small-group coaching for Go, AWS, or platform engineers leveling up.

## Sample results
- Launched a payment microservice in Go that now processes 2M+ requests/day with &lt;120 ms p95 latency.
- Cut AWS spend by 32% by right-sizing ECS workloads, adding autoscaling policies, and optimizing storage tiers.
- Reduced deploy time from 45 to 12 minutes by reworking CI/CD, release trains, and IaC pipelines using Terraform + GitHub Actions.
- Delivered multi-Region failover readiness for an IoT platform using AWS Lambda, SQS, EventBridge, and DynamoDB.
- Helped three engineers earn AWS SAA/DVA certifications via targeted study plans and drills.

## Timezone & collaboration
- Based in Taipei (UTC+8) with consistent overlap to Pacific, Eastern, and Central European hours.
- Async-first updates via Loom/Notion plus real-time standups or pairing where needed.
- Comfortable across GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Jira, Linear, ClickUp, Clubhouse, Notion, and Confluence.

## Why the AWS certification matters
- Deep familiarity with AWS core services (ECS, EKS, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Aurora, SQS/SNS, CloudWatch).
- Able to translate Well-Architected best practices into real CI/CD, IaC, and observability workflows.
- Trusted to audit IAM/security posture, implement guardrails, and document handoffs for internal teams.

## Pricing & availability
- **Project engagements** start at two weeks with fixed-scope pricing tied to business outcomes.
- **Monthly retainers** begin at 40 hours/month and include guaranteed response times for incidents or AWS escalations.
- **Full-time contracts** are available for 3+ month commitments.
- **Discovery calls** are free—expect a clear proposal within 48 hours of chatting.

## FAQ
### Do you work with US-based teams?
Yes. I regularly overlap with Pacific and Eastern teams via early-morning availability and async reporting.

### Can you join existing Go monorepos and platforms?
Absolutely. I have hands-on experience with Go modules, gRPC, GraphQL, REST, and event-driven systems.

### Do you help with hiring full-time engineers?
Yes. I can interview candidates, design take-home exercises, and create onboarding plans so your hires ramp faster.
