# Remote Senior Go & AWS Developer for Hire

Need a remote senior software engineer who can own Go services, modernize AWS, and mentor your team without a months-long hiring process? As an **<a href="https://www.credly.com/badges/f506ac5c-7a57-4edb-aafc-d8bbab0f511f/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">AWS Certified Developer (DVA-C02)</a>** with hands-on Go and cloud experience, I help distributed startups and scaleups ship faster while keeping cloud costs predictable. Think of this as hiring both a principal Go engineer and a pragmatic cloud architect—without adding full-time headcount immediately.

## Who hires me
- **Product-led SaaS teams** that need a principal-level Go engineer to stabilize and extend APIs and cloud infrastructure.
- **Fintech and data companies** chasing lower latency, stronger security, or compliance readiness across AWS services.
- **Consultancies & agencies** that need trusted delivery leadership for client projects spanning Go, Lambda, ECS/EKS, or serverless.
- **DevRel & training orgs** that want an AWS-certified engineer to teach, write, and coach.

## Engagement options
- **Remote full-time** — join as a contracted Senior/Principal Go & AWS engineer while you close a permanent hire.
- **Freelance/contract** — scoped backlog delivery, migrations, AWS modernization, and performance initiatives.
- **Fractional leadership** — 1–2 days per week covering architecture reviews, planning, hiring support, and AWS governance.
- **Mentorship pods** — small-group coaching for Go, AWS, or platform engineers leveling up.

## What I typically deliver
- High-throughput Go microservices built for production traffic and low latency.
- AWS cost optimization through right-sizing, autoscaling, and storage tier reviews.
- Faster CI/CD pipelines using Terraform, GitHub Actions, and streamlined release processes.
- Multi-region and failover architectures leveraging Lambda, SQS, EventBridge, and DynamoDB.
- AWS certification coaching (SAA/DVA) with structured study plans and hands-on drills.

## Timezone & collaboration
- Based in Taipei (UTC+8) with consistent overlap to Pacific, Eastern, and Central European hours.
- Async-first updates via Loom/Notion plus real-time standups or pairing where needed.
- Comfortable across GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, Jira, Linear, ClickUp, Clubhouse, Notion, and Confluence.

## Why the AWS certification matters

{% include aws-badge.html size="large" %}

- Deep familiarity with AWS core services (ECS, EKS, Lambda, API Gateway, DynamoDB, Aurora, SQS/SNS, CloudWatch).
- Able to translate Well-Architected best practices into real CI/CD, IaC, and observability workflows.
- Trusted to audit IAM/security posture, implement guardrails, and document handoffs for internal teams.

## Pricing & availability
- **Project engagements** start at two weeks with fixed-scope pricing tied to business outcomes.
- **Monthly retainers** begin at 40 hours/month and include guaranteed response times for incidents or AWS escalations.
- **Full-time contracts** are available for 3+ month commitments.
- **Discovery calls** are free—expect a clear proposal within 48 hours of chatting.

## FAQ
### Do you work with US-based teams?
Yes. I regularly overlap with Pacific and Eastern teams via early-morning availability and async reporting.

### Can you join existing Go monorepos and platforms?
Absolutely. I have hands-on experience with Go modules, gRPC, GraphQL, REST, and event-driven systems.

### Do you help with hiring full-time engineers?
Yes. I can interview candidates, design take-home exercises, and create onboarding plans so your hires ramp faster.
