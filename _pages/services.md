# Services

I offer pragmatic, outcomes‑driven help across Go backend development and AWS for remote teams that need senior leadership without the hiring lag.

## Companies
- **AWS architecture & migration** — strategy, IaC, security, cost savings.
- **Go services** — microservices, APIs, latency, and performance work.
- **DevOps enablement** — CI/CD, observability, SRE guardrails, incident playbooks.
- **Fractional leadership** — reviews, decision support, roadmap facilitation, mentoring.

## Individuals & teams
- **AWS certification coaching** (SAA, DVA) — plans, drills, accountability, exam strategy.
- **Interview prep** — coding, system design, managerial, and behavioral practice.
- **Workshops** — Go, cloud, architecture, DevOps, and platform enablement.

## Popular engagement formats
- **Remote sprint team** — 2–6 week sprints to ship a feature, migration, or performance fix.
- **Freelance retainer** — guaranteed availability each month for roadmap support and incidents.
- **Assessment + action plan** — deep dive report on Go codebases or AWS accounts with prioritized fixes.
- **Coaching cohorts** — multi-week programs for engineers pursuing promotions or AWS certifications.

## How we work
- Free 30‑minute consult to align on goals and urgency.
- Clear scope, milestones, and success metrics within 48 hours.
