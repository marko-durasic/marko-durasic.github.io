# Hire Me

I partner with remote teams that need a senior Go/AWS engineer who can lead architecture, own delivery, and unblock hiring plans quickly. I am comfortable stepping in as a full-time remote teammate, a freelance/contract engineer, or a fractional technical lead focused on outcomes. Need a dedicated landing page to share with stakeholders? Visit the **[Remote Senior Go Developer offer](/remote-senior-go-developer/)**.

## Engagement models
- **Full-time remote hire** — Senior Software Engineer / Tech Lead embedded in your team (UTC+8 overlap with US/EU/APAC).
- **Freelance & contract projects** — Scoped builds, migrations, or performance/cost initiatives with fixed or retainer pricing.
- **Fractional leadership** — 40–60 hours/month covering architecture reviews, roadmaps, and mentoring for in-house engineers.
- **Coaching & enablement** — AWS certification coaching, interview prep, and hands-on workshops that level up teams fast.

For more detail on deliverables, visit the **[Services](/services/)** page.

## Problems I solve fast
- Launching or rewriting **Go microservices** that handle real traffic.
- Untangling **AWS bills, reliability, or security gaps** without slowing shipping.
- Standing up **DevOps tooling** (CI/CD, IaC, observability) so engineers ship confidently.
- Coaching internal teams so you can hire, onboard, and retain talent at scale.

## Proof that matters
- **AWS Developer Associate (DVA‑C02)** — [Credly](https://www.credly.com/badges/f506ac5c-7a57-4edb-aafc-d8bbab0f511f/){:target="_blank"}
- **Cloud Coach** — interactive AWS study tool I built to help engineers prepare for certifications.
- Experience reducing AWS spend, accelerating CI/CD pipelines, and shipping Go backend services from scratch.
- Case studies and background on the **[About](/about/)** page.

## Why remote collaboration works
- Clear async updates, loom walkthroughs, and crisp documentation keep stakeholders aligned.
- Flexible overlap with Pacific, Eastern, and Central European hours despite being based in Taipei.
- Comfortable working across Jira, Linear, ClickUp, GitHub Projects, or whatever stack you prefer.

## Simple process
1. 30‑minute discovery call to confirm fit and outcomes.
2. Tailored proposal with scope, budget, milestones, and success metrics.
3. Kickoff focused on highest-impact work first, with weekly demos and transparent reporting.
